## PRONTO Bike Share Visualization

### Summary
Pronto is a Seattle-based bike share service. This visualization tries to show the varied frequency in bike sharing on
Weekdays and Weekends. The frequency on Weekdays corresponds to the office hours ie morning and evening whereas on Weekdays it is mostly in the afternoon.

### Design
The visualization is an animated flow of trips between stations across Seattle throughout the day, with a Histogram and a progress indicator as the guide to show the frequency distribution of the bike trips. After the animation is over one can move the progress indicator to see the bike trips at specific times through the day.

### Feedback

1. It was very difficult to understand from just the progressive animation as to what the frequency actually is. So I decided to show a time based histogram to give a better understanding of the visualization.
1. After the animation was over there was no interaction with the graph and one was left confused as to what do next. So I decided to make the progress indicator controllable.
1. To give more interactivity to the graph I decided to let the user even control the day of the visualization that the user wants to see bike trends of.
